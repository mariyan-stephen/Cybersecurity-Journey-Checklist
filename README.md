## Introduction

Before diving in, it's essential to understand the basics of computer networks, HTTP/HTTPS, and the basics of Python for scripting. You can find resources for these in the following sections.

## Web Security

Web security is about protecting websites or online services against different security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an application's code. 

1. **Basics of Web Security**: Start by learning the basics. Here's a [good introduction course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-security-fundamentals).
2. **OWASP Top 10**: Understand the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Here's the [official OWASP guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
3. **WebGoat**: Practice what you've learned on [WebGoat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project), an intentionally insecure web application maintained by OWASP.

## Malware Analysis

Malware analysis is the process of determining the origin, functionality, and potential impact of a given malware sample such as a virus, worm, or Trojan horse. 

1. **Introduction to Malware Analysis**: Check out this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/malware-analysis-course/).
2. **Practical Malware Analysis**: This [book](https://nostarch.com/malware) is a great resource for getting started with practical malware analysis.
3. **Malware Analysis Samples**: Practice your skills with real malware samples from [theZoo](http://thezoo.morirt.com/), a repository of live malwares.

## Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data.

1. **Basics of Ethical Hacking**: Start learning from this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/).
2. **Hack The Box**: Practice your skills on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), a website where you can test and advance your skills.
3. **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**: If you're interested in making a career out of ethical hacking, consider studying for and obtaining the [CEH certification](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/).
